====================
v2.0rc Release Notes
====================

* complete rewrite of deck as a bash script, to support overlayFS (Debian
  9/Stretch default union FS).

* full and/or expected functionality of previous versions of deck (as per 
  TKLDev docs) is not yet fully implemented (hence the 'rc' moniker). We 
  hope to resolve that in a(n unyet) planned future release of Deck v2.0
  proper.

  Of particular importance to note:

  - prior decks will appear empty; the actual files can be found in:

    .deck/$deck_name/upper

  - root.sandbox is still built, but previous functionality as documented in
    TKLDev no longer holds true. Having said that, modifications made in
    root.sandbox, will make it into the ISO, just not as a separate overlay.
